Unified Strategic Intelligence System

**ACT** (Agentic Cognitive Terminal) is the technical manifestation of the **Personal Assistant** (المساعد الشخصي) project. It is designed to be a high-performance, privacy-first digital companion that manages productivity, health, and strategic goals through a "Sovereign" interface.

## Vision
The Sovereign Assistant is not a tool; it is a strategic partner...
 of the **Personal Assistant** (المساعد الشخصي) project. It is designed to be a high-performance, privacy-first digital companion that manages productivity, health, and strategic goals through a "Sovereign" interface.

## 🚀 Vision
To move beyond simple task management into a fully integrated cognitive environment that:
- Decomposes complex thoughts into actionable tasks.
- Tracks time with extreme precision to eliminate "time leakage".
- Gamifies progress through the **Sovereign Rank** system.
- Provides a "Daily Loop" for constant alignment with long-term goals (OKRs).

## 📂 Project Structure
- `src/`: Core Next.js application source.
  - `components/`: Pure UI and functional components.
  - `lib/`: Business logic (Productivity, Gamification, Analytics).
  - `hooks/`: Custom state and storage management.
  - `types/`: Unified system type definitions.
- `docs/`: Strategic and operational documentation (ported from Personal Assistant).
  - `workflow.md`: The Daily/Weekly/Monthly operational loop.
  - `architecture.md`: System design and design principles.
  - `transition_roadmap.md`: The path to full paperless integration.

## 🛠 Getting Started

First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the interface.

## 📊 Operational Workflow
ACT follows a strict operational workflow defined in [workflow.md](file:///Users/Mohammad%20Al-atrash/Data/MO/projects/Ai/act/docs/workflow.md). This includes:
1. **The Daily Loop**: Morning planning, active tracking, and evening feedback.
2. **The Weekly Review**: Saturday analysis and cleanup.
3. **The Monthly Reset**: OKR alignment.
